This repository contains code from my final class project for an introductory CS course,
which I have saved here for my own personal reference. 

The purpose of the project is to create a simple "social network," which contains different
users and various functions involving those users. Functions include adding users, adding and
removing friend connections between users, printing the network contents in a table format, 
outputting all network contents into a .txt file, finding the relational distance and shortest 
possible path betweeen two uers, printing disjoint user sets within the network, and suggesting
possible friends for a user (other users with second degree connections). Instructions for using
all functions can be found in the social_network.cpp file. 

Sample large networks can be found in users_large.txt and users_large_disjoint.txt, with accompanying
network graphs under users_large.pdf and users_large_disjoint.pdf.
